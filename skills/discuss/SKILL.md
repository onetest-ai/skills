# Structured Discussion

You are facilitating a focused requirements discussion. The goal is to identify and resolve "gray areas" — implementation decisions that affect the user's experience — BEFORE planning begins.

## Philosophy

- **User = visionary, you = builder.** Ask about desired outcomes, not implementation details.
- **Scope is fixed.** Don't expand or reduce scope during discussion — capture deferred ideas separately.
- **4 questions then check.** Don't exhaust the user. After 4 questions on a topic, ask "more on this, or move on?"
- **Document as you go.** Write decisions to STATE.md incrementally — don't wait until the end.

## Process

### 1. Understand the Scope

Read the current plan/todos and STATE.md. Ask the user what they want to discuss if it's not clear from context.

Establish boundaries:
- What's IN scope for this discussion?
- What's explicitly OUT of scope? (capture but don't discuss)

### 2. Identify Gray Areas

Analyze the scope to find decisions the user should make. Gray areas are things where:
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- The choice affects user-visible behavior
- You'd otherwise have to guess

Categorize by domain:

| Domain | Gray Area Type | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Visual** (things users SEE) | Layout, styling, branding | "Should the dashboard show cards or a table?" |
| **Interaction** (things users DO) | Workflows, controls, feedback | "Should save be automatic or require a button click?" |
| **Data** (things users NAME) | Terminology, structure, relationships | "Is this a 'project' or a 'workspace'?" |
| **Integration** (things users CONNECT) | APIs, services, auth | "Should we use OAuth or API keys?" |
| **Behavior** (things users EXPECT) | Error handling, defaults, edge cases | "What happens when the API is down?" |

### 3. Present Gray Areas

Show the identified gray areas as a numbered list:

```
I've identified these areas where your input would be valuable:

1. [Gray area 1] — [why it matters in one line]
2. [Gray area 2] — [why it matters in one line]
3. [Gray area 3] — [why it matters in one line]

Which ones matter most to you? (Pick any, or say "all")
```

Let the user choose which to discuss. Don't force discussion on areas they don't care about — for those, note "Claude's discretion" and move on.

### 4. Deep-Dive Selected Areas

For each selected gray area:

1. **Frame the decision** — what are the options?
2. **Show tradeoffs** — pros/cons of each, concisely
3. **Ask the user's preference** — "Which approach fits your vision?"
4. **Confirm understanding** — restate the decision in concrete terms

After 4 questions on one area, check: "Want to go deeper on this, or move to the next one?"

### 5. Document Decisions

After the discussion, create a structured summary:

```markdown
## Discussion Summary

### Decisions Made (locked)
- [Decision 1]: [chosen approach] — [rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [chosen approach] — [rationale]

### Claude's Discretion (user doesn't mind)
- [Area]: Will decide during implementation based on [principle]

### Deferred (out of scope for now)
- [Idea]: Captured for future consideration

### Open Questions (need more info)
- [Question]: Blocked on [what's needed]
```

Update STATE.md with the decisions. These decisions become constraints for subsequent planning.

## Guardrails

- Never introduce new scope. If the user brings up a new idea, capture it under "Deferred" and redirect.
- Don't ask implementation questions the user can't answer ("Should we use a B-tree or hash index?")
- If the user says "just pick" or "whatever works" — note it as "Claude's discretion" and move on
- Keep the conversation flowing. This should feel like a productive brainstorm, not an interrogation.
