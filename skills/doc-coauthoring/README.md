# doc-coauthoring

Structured 3-stage workflow for co-authoring documentation, proposals, specs, and decision docs with the user.

## Usage

```
/doc-coauthoring
/doc-coauthoring write a technical spec for the new auth system
```

## Stages

1. **Context Gathering** — Meta-context questions, info dumping, targeted clarifications
2. **Refinement & Structure** — Section-by-section building with brainstorming and curation
3. **Reader Testing** — Verify with fresh context (sub-agent or manual)

## When to Use

- Writing proposals, RFCs, PRDs, decision docs
- Creating technical specifications
- Drafting structured content collaboratively
- Any document that benefits from systematic context gathering before writing
